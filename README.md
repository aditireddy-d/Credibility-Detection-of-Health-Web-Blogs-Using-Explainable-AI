This project focuses on addressing the critical issue of misinformation in online health blogs. By utilizing a combination of machine learning models, the PageRank algorithm, and explainable AI techniques, the aim is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the credibility of health-related content. The project leverages a multidimensional approach to evaluate various aspects of web blogs, including website features, author credibility, and customer ratings.

---- Key Components:

1.Data Collection: Utilizes the fake health dataset from the Ginger Cannot Cure Cancer repository.

2.PageRank Algorithm: Analyzes the link structure of web pages to determine their importance and credibility.

3.Machine Learning Models: Employs Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression to predict credibility scores.

4.Author Analysis: Assesses writing style, grammar, readability, and domain expertise.

5.Customer Ratings: Utilizes classification models like KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.

6.Explainable AI: Implements SHAP values to provide transparency and insights into model decisions.
